Mike Klubnika and Critical Reflex have worked hard on this game. Please show them respect and don't pirate the game. Any requests to see the source code without verification of ownership will be ignored.

## Available Mods
_This list is outdated due to the latest updates and will be updated soon!_
- [TestMod](https://github.com/AGO061/BuckshotRouletteModLoader/blob/main/mods/TestMod.md) by AGO061 ([ModLoader version support](https://github.com/AGO061/BuckshotRouletteModLoader/blob/main/mods/ModLoaderVersionSupport.md#testmod-by-ago061)) - a basic test mod that moves the soap bar from one side of the sink to the other.

Make a shortcut on Windows and add at the end of the path this command `--rendering-driver opengl3 -cm` for an easier way to run with OpenGL3 + Fix.

Check [this](https://github.com/AGO061/BuckshotRouletteModLoader/blob/main/mods/ModLoaderVersionSupport.md) file in case I missed some mods here, or haven't added the Mod Version Support link.
## Currently supported features
- Basic mod support: allows to load custom mod zips to a mods folder in the same directory as the game.
- Normal fix: Fixed normals from the [GDRE Tools](https://github.com/bruvzg/gdsdecomp) decompilation of the game.
- Default render pipeline: This version uses the Forward+ renderer by default (unlike the absolutely illegal web and mobile ports)
- Possibility to add a custom config menu for your mod! (Check the TestMod source code to learn how as I currently don't have the time to write a wiki)
- Multiplayer support on your own [servers](#server). **WARNING:** NO STEAM MULTIPLAYER support for patched games!

## Advantages for users and developers
- Easy installation of mods
- Development of mods can be done on the decompilation of the game and then used seamlessly here, or you can try to decompile the patched game and work from there.

## Known issues
- Missing checks for game version, mod dependencies, and collisions.
- No Steam Achievements / Multiplayer (Ethical Reasons, no discussion)

# Installation
## Windows
### Requirements
- Buckshot Roulette.exe (Steam v2.1.0.11 or itch.io v1.2.2.3)
- BRML_setup.exe ([available here or in the "Releases" section](https://github.com/AGO061/BuckshotRouletteModLoader/releases/latest))
  _or_
- A delta patching software (not recommended)

Run the setup .exe after you have installed the original game. The mod will be installed to `Documents`. Then use the created shortcut, the included `brml.bat` file, or the modded .exe to run the game. It's that easy!

## Linux
### Requirements
 - Buckshot Roulette.x86_64 (Steam v2.1.0.11 or itch.io v1.2.2.3)
 - xdelta3 (`sudo apt install xdelta3`)
 - unzip (`sudo apt install unzip`)

Once `Buckshot Roulette.x86_64` is in a directory on your computer, run the following commands from the folder where the original game file is:
```
mkdir Buckshot\ Roulette
cd Buckshot\ Roulette
mkdir mods override configs
wget https://github.com/AGO061/BuckshotRouletteModLoader/releases/download/3.1.0/brml3_linux_steam.xdelta
wget https://github.com/AGO061/BuckshotRouletteModLoader/releases/download/3.1.0/brml.sh
xdelta3 -d -s ../Buckshot\ Roulette.x86_64 brml3_linux_steam.xdelta Buckshot\ Roulette.x86_64
rm brml3_linux_steam.xdelta
chmod +x brml.sh Buckshot\ Roulette.x86_64
```
*Note: Replace `brml3_linux_steam.xdelta` with `brml3_linux_itch.xdelta` if necessary.*

You can now run the BRML using the command `./brml.sh` in the `Buckshot Roulette` directory.

## Server
### Requirements
 - brml3_server.exe (Windows)
   _or_
 - brml3_server.x86_64 (Linux)

Run the server executable to be able to connect with other players in native multiplayer (no mods). You can specify the server URL and create a username in the mod config menu for the modloader (Mods -> gear icon).

To allow players on other networks to play with you:
 - Find the IP address of the device hosting the server
 - Configure your router settings to forward port 2096 on that IP address with UDP
 - Find your public IP address (search online for "What is my IP address" or check your router's settings) and give that to other players

## Troubleshooting
To run the Windows installer version with OpenGL3, change the following line in `brml.bat`:
```
start "" "%%i"
```
  to this:
```
start "" "%%i" --rendering-driver opengl3
```
For the Linux `brml.sh` file, change the following line:
```
$game
```
  to this:
```
$game --rendering-driver opengl3
```
Report any other issues with installation to the Issues page.

# Adding Mods
If you used the installation methods above, you should already have a `mods` folder. Otherwise, Create a `mods` folder in the same folder as your executable. Drop all the mod zips in there. Check the `mods` folder in this repo to see a test mod that simply moves the soap in the bathroom.

# Development
Check out the [BRML Development wiki](https://github.com/AGO061/BuckshotRouletteModLoader/wiki) for more info
